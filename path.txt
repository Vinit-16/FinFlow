Divides investments into four main categories:

Equity (Large, Mid, Small Cap, International)
Debt (Government Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Money Market)
Hybrid (Balanced Funds, Monthly Income Plans)
Alternatives (Gold, Real Estate)


Adjusts for both risk and age:

Base allocation determined by risk score (1-10)
Age adjustment reduces equity exposure as age increases
Maintains minimum allocations in each category for diversification


Provides specific investment vehicles:

Recommends actual funds based on risk profile
Includes mix of mutual funds, ETFs, REITs, and bonds
Suggests both active and passive investment options

The key differentiators in allocations based on risk score are:

Conservative (1-3): Focus on capital preservation, higher debt allocation
Moderate (4-6): Balanced approach with significant diversification
Aggressive (7-10): Higher equity exposure, including small caps and international
